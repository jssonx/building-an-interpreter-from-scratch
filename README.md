# Eva: A Functional Programming Language

## Overview

Eva is a modern functional programming language designed to offer an intuitive and powerful approach to software development. It seamlessly integrates core concepts of functional programming with the versatility of object-oriented paradigms.

## Features

- **Basic Expressions & Variables:** Eva handles basic expressions and variables with a focus on scopes and lexical environments. It features robust control structures and employs a parser generator for syntax analysis.

- **Functional Programming:** The language supports function abstraction and invocation with an emphasis on closures, lambda functions, and IILEs (Immediately-invoked Lambda Expressions). It also includes a well-defined call-stack, supports recursion, and provides syntactic sugar for enhanced readability.

- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Eva extends its functionality to object-oriented concepts, offering both class-based and prototype-based paradigms. It allows developers to define classes, create instances, and organize code into modules for better modularity.

## Getting Started

To run Eva programs, use the following command:

```bash
$ ./bin/eva -f ./path/to/yourfile.eva
```

## Testing

Eva includes a comprehensive test suite written in JavaScript. To run the tests, execute:

```bash
$ node __tests__/run.js
```
